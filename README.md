## Proposal

Our team introduces "AI_dashboard," which revolutionizes how organizations interact with and derive insights from blockchain data. This solution combines the power of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to facilitate data access and analysis while maintaining high levels of data integrity.

The core of AI_dashboard is a locally hosted desktop application that allows users to query blockchain data using natural language. Leveraging fine-tuned AI models, our system transforms intuitive natural language inputs into precise data query commands, eliminating traditional barriers between users and data. This approach makes blockchain data analysis accessible to team members of all technical levels, from skilled developers to business analysts.

The platform's architecture is built on direct blockchain integration that connects to Hyperledger Fabric through gRPC, ensuring data integrity by eliminating potential points of corruption in the data transmission process. The fine-tuned AI model translates natural language requests into executable queries, allowing users to extract meaningful insights from blockchain data without requiring expertise in programming languages or blockchain technology.

This document will detail the AI model development process for AI_dashboard. We will explain step-by-step the entire process, from the methodology of collecting training data using the latest generative AI models such as GPT-4 and Claude, to attempting fine-tuning on various language models like BERT, RoBERTa, and T5 using the collected data, and comparing and analyzing the performance of each model to derive the optimal model.

Our solution eliminates intermediary-related data corruption risks, improves accessibility for non-technical users, maintains data integrity through blockchain immutability, provides real-time data analysis capabilities, reduces dependence on specialized technical personnel, and ensures secure local processing of sensitive information.
